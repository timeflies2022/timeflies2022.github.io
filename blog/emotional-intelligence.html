        <em><p class="first">What is Emotional Interlligence/EQ?</p></em>
        <p>"Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, 
          communicate effectively, emphasize with others, overcome challenges and defuse confliec."</p>

        <em><p class="first">How is it different to IQ?</p></em>
        <p>Intelligence Quotient, "is a score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess intelligence."</p>
        <p>EQ is all about emotion. How well do you understand your own and others emotions.  IQ reflects how intellectual you are. 
          Your ability to learn, understand and apply information to skills.</p>

        <em><p class="first">Why is it important?</p></em>
        <p>Having high level of Emotional Intelligence is important in modern society. We are living in times of change causing us to feel uncertain about the future. 
          In order to adopt with the change we put ourselves under immense amout of stress. This is where having high EQ comes in handy. Being able to understand and 
          manage your own emotions will lead to an overall healthier and positive life. I feel only after you have the full control over your own mind and emotion, only then, 
          you can be a positive influence to others.<br>
