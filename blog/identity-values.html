          <p class="identity">Core personal values:</p>
          <p>My core personal values are integrity, kindness and generosity. I 
          like the saying “what goes around comes around”.</p>
          <p>Everyday we have to fight ourselves to make ethical decisions. One moment when I made an ethical decision 
          is back when I was much younger. While I was walking to the dairy there I spotted a $50 note drop from someones 
          pocket and the person had no idea this had happened. I could have just picked up the money but I could not do 
          that. I picked up the money and walked up to the person to return it to the owner. This was when 
          I was 13 years old and $50 was a lot to me then. To this day I'm proud that I have made the right decision.</p>
          <p class="identity">Strengths/Limitations:</p>
          <p>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</p>
          <p>I tend to work things out on my own ways. Most of the times this is good as when it comes to learning a new 
            concept, working things out on my own helps me to fully understand the concept and to put it into practice. 
            However, this also limits me with time management. As I may get stuck on a idea or concept and spend unnecessary 
            amount of time. Asking for help and getting help from others can help fix/understand things more appropriately.</p>
          <p>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
          <p>My strengths: Strong work ethic and I finish work on time.</p>
          <p>My strong work ethic has helped me get through a lot of challenges in life. As I have no prior background knowledge in programming, getting through Dev Academy 
            will be another challenge that I will need to break through. This is where my strengths will come in handy.</p>
