          <p class="identity">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
          <p>My long term goal is to become a successful front end developer.</p>
          <p class="identity">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
          <p>My strengths when it comes to learning is that I tend to pick up new learning/materials quick. And my limitation is that I forget things quickly as well. 
            To not let this happen I will revise on my learning again the next day.</p>
          <p class="identity">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
          <p>Communication skills. Working in IT, I believe you need to have great communication skills. Therefore, I want to become more fluent in speaking my mind to others.</p>
          <p class="identity">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
          <p>I believe clear communication is key to work productively and safely with others. Talking with your team and your facilitators when things seem to become overwhelming.</p>
          <p class="identity">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
          <p>Supportive mentor. Someone I can ask for help when needed.</p>
