      <b>Core personal values:</b>
    </div>
  <div>
    My core personal values are integrity, kindness and generosity. I like the saying “what goes around comes around”. 
  </div>
 <div class="class1">
  Everyday we have to fight ourselves to make ethical decisions. One moment when I made an ethical decision is back 
  when I was much younger. While I was walking to the dairy there I spotted a $50 note drop from someones pocket and 
  the person had no idea this had happened. I could have just picked up the money but I could not do that. I picked up 
  the money and walked up to the person to return it to the owner. This was when I was 13 years old and $50 was a lot 
  to me then.  To this day I'm proud that I have made the right decision.

 <h2> Strengths/Limitations: </h2>
<div>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
</div>
<div class="class1"> I tend to work things out on my own ways. Most of the times this is good as when it comes to learning a new concept, 
working things out on my own helps me to fully understand the concept and to put it into practice. However, this also 
limits me with time management. As I may get stuck on a idea or concept and spend unnecessary amount of time. Asking 
for help and getting help from others can help fix/understand things more appropriately. </div>

<div class="third">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning 
  obstacles.</div>
  <div class="class1">My strengths:  Strong work ethic and I finish work on time. </div>
  <div class="class1">My strong work ethic has helped me get through a lot of challenges in life. 
    As I have no prior background knowledge in programming, getting through Dev Academy will be another 
    challenge that I will need to break through. 
    This is where my strengths will come in handy.</div>
