        <h2>Sprint 4: Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Neuroplasticity</p>
        <p>
          Scientists believed that our brain stayed static and unchanged after reaching at a certain age. 
          However, modern studies proves that this in fact is not true and that our brains are like plastic, 
          adaptable and constantly changing. 
        </p>
        <p>10 Principles of Neuroplasticity:</p>
        <p>1. Use it or lose it: Failure to drive specific brain functions can lead to loss of abilities. </p>
        <p>2. Use it and improve it: Training that drives a specific brain function can lead to improving abilities. </p>
        <p>3. Specificity: The nature of the training experience dictates the nature of the change in the brain (plasticity). </p>
        <p>4. Repetition matters: Change (plasticity) requires sufficient repetition. </p>
        <p>5. Intensity matters: Change (plasticity) requires intensive training. </p>
        <p>6. Time matters: Different forms of change (plasticity) in the brain happen at different times during training. </p>
        <p>7. Salience matters: The training experience must be meaningful to the person in order to cause change (plasticity). </p>
        <p>8. Age matters: Training-induced change (plasticity) occurs more readily in younger brains. </p>
        <p>9. Transference: Change in function as a result of one training experience can even lead to learning other similar skills. </p>
        <p>10. Interference: Brain changes (plasticity) that result in bad habits can interfere with learning good habits. </p>
        <p>
          If we think about something differently, learning a new task or choose a different emotion we are building a new 
          pathway in our brain. The more we travel along this new road our brain will build stronger connection 
          which in the future will become second nature. Use the other pathway less then it will become weaker over time.

        <p class="paragraph">Growth Mindset</p>
        <p>Having growth mindset is the idea of enjoying challenges and in the cases where you fail a task or a test you 
          don’t think yourself as a failure. Instead, you tell yourself that you are on a learning curve and you simply are 
          ‘yet’ to accomplish this task. 
        </p>
        <p>So how can we develop a growth mindset? </p>
        <p>Firstly, we need to listen to the mindset voice inside of us. Listen to our mindset and recognize what type of mindset 
          we have. This will allow better understanding of ourselves so we can change any irrelevant voices. 
        </p>
        <p>After discovering our true mindset we can start talking back with a growth mindset voice. Changing our fixed mindset 
          to a growth mindset. We can achieve this by practice. Replacing words like “failure”, “never” and “no” with 
          understanding that failing is just a new way of learning.

        <p class="paragraph">Applying Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset to my learning plan</p>
        <p>The ideas of neuroplasticity and growth mindset were not something completely new to me. I was aware of it but something 
          I had forgotten over the years. Now I am reminded of the benefits it can on me, therefore I will apply both ideas into my 
          learning. When I hit a brick wall and feel lost in the future, I will remember to think with growth mindset and believe 
          in neuroplasticity.
