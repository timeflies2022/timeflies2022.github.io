        <h2>Sprint 2: Learning-Plan</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
        <p>My long term goal is to become a successful front end developer.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
        <p>My strengths when it comes to learning is that I tend to pick up new learning/materials quick. And my 
          limitation is that I forget things quickly as well. To not let this happen I will revise on my learning again 
          the next day.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
        <p>
          Communication skills. Working in IT, I believe you need to have great communication skills. Therefore, I want to become 
          more fluent in speaking my mind to others.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: 
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators 
          and industry/community representatives What you will do when things are 
          building up and starting to get to you A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </p>
        <p>I believe clear communication is key to work productively and safely with others. Talking with your team and your facilitators when 
          things seem to become overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
        <p>Supportive mentor. Someone I can ask for help when needed.</p>

        <h2>Sprint 5: Learning-Plan Update</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</p>
        <p>Prior to foundation I thought I had the ability to pick up new concepts quickly but now I realise that this was a 
          big misunderstanding. My biggest strengths going into bootcamp is perseverance and growth mindset. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</p>
        <p>Managing the stress load. Bootcamp is going to be very intense 9 weeks of my life.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
        <p>I would like to perfect my teamwork skills. In order to achieve this, I feel I will need to work on honesty, clear communication,
          receiving feedbacks and giving constructive feedbacks.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team? </p>
        <p>Supportive and most importantly HONEST mentor. I am ready to take in constructive feedback.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp  </p>
        <p>I believe I still have long way to go and Iâ€™m unsure if I am ready for bootcamp but I will spend my week very productively so I 
          am ready to go hard in weeks' time. I also feel I will be needing a lot of help in bootcamp, thus I will seek help whenever needed 
          and manage my time productively. I will try to take my very best approach in all group activities and try to be a help to the group. 
          And to achieve this I will spend good portion of my time exchanging conversations with my team to really have a good understanding of 
          our goal as group and to make sure we are heading towards the same outcome.
