        <h2>Sprint 1: My Identity and Values</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Core personal values:</p>
        <p>My core personal values are integrity, kindness and generosity. I like the saying “what goes around comes around”.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Strengths/Limitations:</p>
        <p>
          Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
        </p>
        <p>
          I tend to work things out on my own ways. Most of the times this is good as when it comes to learning a new 
          concept, working things out on my own helps me to fully understand the concept and to put it into practice. 
          However, this also limits me with time management. As I may get stuck on a idea or concept and spend unnecessary 
          amount of time. Asking for help and getting help from others can help fix/understand things more appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
        <p>My strengths: Strong work ethic and I finish work on time.</p>
        <p>My strong work ethic has helped me get through a lot of challenges in life. As I have no prior background knowledge
          in programming, getting through Dev Academy will be another challenge that I will need to break through. This is 
          where my strengths will come in handy.
