        <h2>Sprint 5: Reflection</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">What are new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</p>
        <p>
          Going over Core learning materials I learned how inefficiently I dealt with my stress. Previously when I 
          had time to spare where I was not so pressured in running out of time, I dealt with stress just fine. 
          However, with time being scarce I was mentally beading myself but thankfully by going over the materials 
          each week. I came to a realization of this and how I need to change my way of releasing stress. 
        </p>
        <p>I’ve always considered myself as a quick learner. So, my egos and my confidence were high before foundation. 
          In the last 5 weeks I learned that this in fact was not true at all.  
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </p>
        <p>The importance of being honest about yourself and really paying attention to your inner thoughts. So you can 
          evaluate yourself honestly and see what you can improve on.  
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p class="paragraph">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?  </p>
        <p>To be honest, all of the Core activities were challenging. Because they are not something I had 
          encountered before. Starting from evaluating my values to listening and looping. At first they came to 
          me as a challenge but I’m starting to get the hang of it. 
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course? </p>
        <p>I have been told that a software developer’s job is not all about coding. Your job will need you to be a member 
          of a group and complete given tasks in a group together. Therefore, a lot of times you will in a meeting, sharing 
          ideas and coming up with a solution with your team. In order to become a good member of a team you will need to 
          understand your strengths and weaknesses to become an essential member.  
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p class="paragraph">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
        <p>The last 5 weeks, I have been given the opportunity to study myself and to really understand who I am. This 
          was achieved through core study materials and I’m very thankful for it. We are living in a such busy world 
          where we tend to lose our characteristics and become someone foreign. The core materials made sure and helped
          me to understood who I really am. </p>
