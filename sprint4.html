      <h2>Sprint 4 - Problem Solving</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Blocked on a simple problem:</p>

      <p>While I was attempting the ‘Manipulating JS object’ kata exercise I came across a very simple problem 
        that took me more than 15 minutes to solve.  
      </p>
      <p><img src="error.png"></p>
      <p>Here, I am instructed to delete terah object’s eyeColor property using the delete keyword. Line 22, I wrote 
        ‘delete terah.eyeColour’ and this line of code seem to not to the trick. This bugged me a lot as I was sure that 
        I wrote the right code. I tried console.logging, Googling and reading error messages. But what made me spot the 
        error was the rubber ducky method. I was so frustrated I started telling myself what this simple line of code was 
        meant to do. Then I spotted the error, spelling error. I wrote ‘eyeColour’ instead of ‘eyeColor’. Throughout the 
        process I felt helpless and annoyed as I had all these other works that needed to be completed and I was stuck on 
        this one simple issue. I started laughing out loud after realising the issue. I learned that “it’s the little 
        things that count.”

      <p class="paragraph">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</p>
      <p>Pseudocode: Breaking down the code into small steps helped me a lot. This makes it easier for me to Google search more efficiently. 
        I feel fairly confident using this technique and would like to give 8/10. 
      </p>
      <p>Rubber ducky method: Also, helpful as this normally helped me to spot out silly small mistakes. 8/10</p>
      <p>Reading error messages: Not so confident when it comes to reading error messages. 5/10 </p>
      <p>Console.logging A lot of the times this technique didn’t really guided me to the right path. But I know how 
        important it is to console.log my code so I will keep on try to improve this technique. 5/10  
      </p>
      <p>Googling: My best friend. Such powerful tool as it has answer to all of my problems. 9/10.</p>
      <p>Asking your peers & coaches for help: Usually, my last resort. I’m just not really used to asking others for 
        help. 4/10
